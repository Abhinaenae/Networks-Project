# Networks-Project
For CS4390 taught by [Dr. Yi Ding](https://yi-ding.me/)


This project involves creating two Python scripts for simulating communication between a client and a server. 

The server is initiated first, waiting for connections from clients. Once the client script is executed and connects to the server with the proper port number, it sends the user's name and a number between 1 and 100 chosen by the user.
The server generates a random number within the same range, adds it to the client's number, and sends the result back to the client. This process repeats until the client inputs a number outside the range of 1 to 100. At that point, both the server and client terminate their connection.

Requirements to run:
- Python3
- A Wi-Fi Connection
